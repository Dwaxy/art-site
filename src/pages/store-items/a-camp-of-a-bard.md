title: A Camp of a Bard
about: >-
  Deep in high country, a Bard of Ornthier caved the runes to a song long ago.
  Now it is a known campsite for hunters. Manny sing and play their flutes to
  the carving, wondering how close they are to the Bards original intention.

Houses south of the Spine are known not only for their music but also their Bards. In tucked way places, particularly groves or caves, Bards or those that fancy themselves one paint, carve and draw their strange music. Originating in the now small but old House of Ornthier (Translating roughly to Mountain Bull), this phenonium was taken up by their neighbours. They too liked the romantic ideal of travelling into one of the South's many frontiers, hoping that a like-minded traveller would stumble upon and interpret one of their tunes scribed on a stone. And interpret they had to. The Bards of Ornthier never meant to communicate their work to others. In fact, few Bards gathered to share their music more than three times in their lives (Though there are folk tales of each time they did). It has always been that one's way of writing was meant only for one's self. Their strange runes and lines were simply meant to serve as a reminder to themselves. But still, music is made to the scribblings on rocks far away, and though the tune is never close to the author's original intention, they became famous anyway. Now the Old Bards are long gone, each a legend of old times. Each walked alone and made music for no one but themselves. But now, the young walk far into the mountains to the words of "Come, Ayed has read the East Rock in a new way, and she says she will let us listen". Many still dream of becoming like Ary, the lost Warrior Bard, mysterious and only seen from a distance.
