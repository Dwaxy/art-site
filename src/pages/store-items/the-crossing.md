title: The Crossing
about: >-
  Three travellers cross the pass bordering the tribal territories to the west.
  Here they spy one of the guard towns with its watchtower ablaze. This shows
  good news; travelling should be safe and trade in the town is open. They will
  need both in order to embark on their mission. 
artistNotes: >-
  This took all day, and that attempt failed. The second successful attempt also
  took all day. Many lessons were learnt, and a new style discovered. While not
  close to the vision I had in mind, it does Capture the atmosphere. That being
  one of (hopefully) distance, height, and a feeling of openness.

The climb over the crossing took them two days. Travelling light, the three trust the news of the tower outpost being open for trade, as they have the coin but now little food. Qeth spied the burning tower first at the tipping point, from the steep climb to the sheer slope of the pass. Their news had proven true, and again they went over their plan to sell their bright lavish coats of merchants for the soft green cloaks and fur of hunters in the woods. From there, they would strike out from the protected trade roads to the secret paths of the wild. Qeth still wonders if being so well dressed would draw questions of kidnapping after their disappearance. Dade doesn't think so. If at all, they would be just another disappearance in the Spines' frontier, just a rumour in a network of newsdealers he knows very well. Though the two argue often over plans, they are confident now. Now, they have Orn; A true Eavidourian in hiding. Dade had found him in an alleyway, pretending to be mute to hide his accent, and with his hear stained with blood to hide his hair. He was their key to go where no one of Qeth's kind could, together the three could go far.
