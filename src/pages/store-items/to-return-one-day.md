about: Dade parts ways with his comrades on his own quest. For now, he passes
  freely over serene hills to find his love over the mountain, who he knows is
  in certain danger.
artistNotes: The jorny continues. Focusing on depth, striving to keep my forms
  clean. Exporing the style found in The Crossing further, and using it to add
  narative to what I hope to become a strong style uneqe to me.

The coice burned him. Deep into the countryside and where two rivers met in a glade of hills, Dade chose to leave his party.

At first the two would not let hm go, cursing him for brining ruin to them all after taking them so far. But Dade convinced them. Here are the wilds, and an open path. They had no use for a spy, and he had no choice. If he was to leave, he could not leave without her. And now he has a chance.

It's the least they would expect, him going back. It had to be here, to put walls of earth between them and slip through the way they came. They would not catch him, and when the three meet again they would be ritch, wild and free. Lost to the world.
