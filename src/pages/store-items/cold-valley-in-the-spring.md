title: Cold Valley in the Spring
about: >-
  A Watercolor sketch of a distant, high valley, with the first day of spring as
  it's dawn. Here a traveller walks alone in a strange world, across the smooth
  stones and patches of snow, returning from a place far away.
artistNotes: >-
  Combining techniques of bold, heavy color mixing on the paper with a simple
  composition and contrast, accidentally created this atmosphere. All paint was
  mixed directly on the paper, allowing for deep warms and cools as the forms
  for this mountainside. Over subtle gradients, abstract forms gave me a feeling
  of strangeness. A productive afternoon, and a nice change.
