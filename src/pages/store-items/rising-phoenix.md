title: Rising Phoenix
about: A Phoenix breaking free of it's dead past self. Though painful, it rises
  again engulfed in the fires of life.
artistNotes: This piece took the entire day. This subject was well suited for
  using wash after wash and letting brushstrokes show. The strong contrasts of
  color make it the most eye-catching work in my room, with subtle shades and
  textures giving it interest and life on closer inspection. For me, a long time
  favorite.
