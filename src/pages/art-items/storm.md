title: storm
about: >-
  Spring storms can be dreary. Torrents of drizzle make up huge sheets of grey.
  But as the clouds break up, they are set alight by rays of morning light
  bursting from within.
artistNotes: >-
  Inspired by a god ray I saw one morning. Storm is the result of a combination
  of techniques for clouds and light.
