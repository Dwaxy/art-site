  The border to the empire and is guarded by a cliff with the height of 150 to
  200 feet. Though the Eavidourean Empire has many regions beyond this wall of
  the earth, the cliff is considered the border of the original lands and the
  Realm or Eavidour. The cliff spans for many leagues and most of the Empire’s
  length, and the only way up is buy use of the \_\_towergate\_\_,  ancient
  structures that climb to the top - and even above - the cliff. These were
  build by the legendary architects in Eavidour’s golden age \_a thousand \_
  years ago, and their main function is a fortified staircase. Each is unique
  but all have a staircase wide enough for the regular transport of people
  supplies, trade, and in times of conquest and war: armies.


  A Towergate is a shell of stone with deep foundations embedded in the cliff
  and ground. In every Towergate there are two angled shells that connect in a
  point, and run all the way up the tower enclosing the staircase, which is
  either a stairwell (in which case the shell has no major openings) or a
  zigzagging staircase that gradually sinks deeper into the cliff face each
  section up. Towergates with this design sometimes have a large open cutout
  near the bottom section, that can open up to half the height of the tower. At
  the bottom of a Towergate, there is an open entrance of angled stone that jut
  out of either side of the shell, supported by massive pillars. Between these,
  shallow stairs take cart and foot under the arc of the stone and between the
  pillars, and up onto a platform for huge woven stone tiles, and into the
  Towergate. Here on the left or right, the stairs begin, winding or zigzagging
  from left to right up into the gloom. The space empty of stairs was filled
  with the signs of camp and trade, lit by braziers. The stairs themselves are
  plain and un-interrupted, except for a flat square platform that is a
  transition between a stairs angle that is a wide and long as the stairs
  themselves. The stairs end only at the top platform, and rise through
  surrounded by a row of fortified walkways to an empty clearing that let to the
  top gate. Set side by side by enormous blocks of stone, steep stairs ran up
  and out into the light.


  Every Towergates top has a thick stone floor with an extended platform raised
  by a few steps with a point narrower and sharper than the rest of the shell it
  fused with. The rest of the top was keep clear for catapults and archers that
  would come if any enemy army would wish to use a Towergate to march an
  invading force up into Eavidour.
