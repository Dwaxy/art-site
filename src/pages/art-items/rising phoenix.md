title: rising phoenix
about: >-
  A depiction of the mythological creature representing rebirth. We are
  ever-changing, and so must let old parts of ourselves die.
artistNotes: >-
  This piece took the entire day. The family table was utterly covered in art
  supplies of which few were actually used. Isn't it amazing; how a mythological
  creature can represent such important parts of us. They are so old. They
  should not be forgotten.
