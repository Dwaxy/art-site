# Elloron Arts

## My Personal Art portfolio and store using Gatsby, React, Graphql Netlify CMS, forms, hosting

## Feachers

- Allows me to quickly add items to the store using custom data structures using Netlify's CMS collections
- Optimisation of images are automatically handled thanks to Gatsby Image
- Items are organised within the site automatically based on tagas and types
- Responsive UI using CSS Grid
- Implements SSR react Paypal for orders
- Has a commission and order form
- Crosslinks Archive items that are also Store items and vice versa

## Things to Improve

- SEO image previews for each page that does not cost performance on site build
- Have the options for multiple images for an item, e.g to show the art framed on a wall
- Page pagination for Archive items based on the item's topic, e.g a series of short stories
- Make index files for components, libs and assets to cut down on imports


## Things I wish I'd done

- Followed a stricter SASS philosophy even with CSS modules
- Made my SASS more component based
- Maybe kept unique components for pages in separate folders
- Some naming inconsistencies as this project draged on for a long time. I don't know why this took so long
- Been more pedantic about some functions in node.js that were not Do Not Repeat friendly
- Separated Sass variables and base styles from the start
- Documented parameters and functions form the start
- Not wastesd all that time trying to send multiple items to paypal. Their docs still overwhelm me
